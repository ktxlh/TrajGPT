# TrajGPT: Controlled Synthetic Trajectory Generation Using a Multitask Transformer-Based Spatiotemporal Model
Link to paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3678717.3691303

## Requirements
Recommended setup: GPU with more than 4GB VRAM and CUDA version 12.3.

## Installation
Use conda to create a virtual environment and pip to install the requirements. 
```bash
conda create --name trajgpt python==3.10.13
conda activate trajgpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To reproduce the results of TrajGPT on GeoLife, please follow these instructions: 

1. Enter the root directory of TrajGPT.
```bash
cd your/path/to/TrajGPT
```

2. Download dataset from [GeoLife GPS Trajectories](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/).
```bash
wget -O data/geolife.zip https://download.microsoft.com/download/F/4/8/F4894AA5-FDBC-481E-9285-D5F8C4C4F039/Geolife%20Trajectories%201.3.zip
```

3. Unzip the data to the `data` folder.
```bash
unzip data/geolife.zip -d data
```

3. Convert point-by-point trajectories to sequences of visits (a.k.a. staypoints).
```bash
python3 preprocess.py
```
This step takes around 5 minutes and only needs to be run once.

4. Run `main.py`. It took around 45 minutes on NVIDIA A100 GPU, or reaching patience after hundreds of epochs.
Please specify the task by replacing `$task` with one of `next_prediction` or `infilling`:
```bash
python3 main.py --task $task
```
